Hi there 👋, I'm __Yannick__!

I'm a freelance dev based in France, obsessed with building things and learning new stuff.

If an idea gets stuck in my head, I'll probably end up building it.

My go-to stack is React Native, Expo, TypeScript, and Next.js. I spend most of my time in mobile and web development but I'm always curious about new tools and technologies.

Currently shipping [Doku](https://www.learnfrenchwithdoku.app/) – a __French learning app__ with graded stories and a cute cat mascot 🐱

I believe in learning by doing, always building something, and improving along the way.

Open to freelance opportunities – [hello@yannickh.dev](mailto:hello@yannickh.dev)
