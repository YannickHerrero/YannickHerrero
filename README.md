Hi there 👋, I'm __Yannick__!

I'm a solo dev based in France, obsessed with building things and learning new stuff.

If an idea gets stuck in my head, I'll probably end up building it.

Currently shipping [Doku](https://www.learnfrenchwithdoku.app/) – a __French learning app__ with graded stories and a cute cat mascot 🐱

My go-to stack is React Native, Expo, TypeScript, and Next.js. I spend most of my time in mobile and web development but I'm always curious about new tools and technologies.

I believe in learning by doing, always building something, and improving along the way.
